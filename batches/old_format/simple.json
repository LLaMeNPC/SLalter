    "Welcome to Jason's weapon shop. What can I do for you?",
    "Please enjoy your stay.",

    "You must gather your party before venturing forth.",
    "Are you sure you want to leave now? It seems like you still have matters to attend to.",

    "I used to be an adventurer like you.",
    "You must save the kingdom.",

    "Could you please get me home?",
    "I need healing.",

    "More gold is required",
    "Your inventory is full.",

    "I've got a lot on my mind.",
    "Theese boots have seen everything.",

    "Sorry, I'm preoccupied right now.",
    "Please don't talk to me anymore.",

    "This place stinks!",
    
    "Hey, what are you doing over there?!",
    "Watch what you're doing or I'll feed you to the hounds!",
    "I will destroy you."
